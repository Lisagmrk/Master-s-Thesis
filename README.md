## US and EU Sanctions on Russia after 2014

This notebook is part of my master's thesis on examining the impact of economic sanctions on Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. It cleans the official sanctions lists of the EU and the US, divides each of them into targeted individuals and targeted entities, and then merges them to a comprehensive list of sanctioned individuals and sanctioned entities. It then identifies firms that were sanctioned indirectly (because either the majority shareholder or the global ultimate owner was sanctioned) and finally matches the comprehensive dataset of all targeted entities with data on economic performance from the ORBIS Europe dataset.
